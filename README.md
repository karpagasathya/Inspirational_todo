# Inspire
Inspire is a useful todo list which motivates you to do more and be better by being more like Kanye West. Whenever the app is visited one of Mr. West's insightful, wise proverbs is randomly generated. It also uses geolocation to display the current weather for the user and informs the user of the day's holiday if there is one.
